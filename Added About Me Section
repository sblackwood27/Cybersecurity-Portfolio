# About Me 
**Name** Stephanie Blackwood Amestica

**Hometown** Lawrenceville, Georgia / United States

**Prior IT Experience**

I have minimum background with IT with some exposure. Working in the Physical Security Industry, specifically, working in operations centers, has fostered and IT / Cybsersecurity mentality. From learning to how to effectively ping IP addresses, to identifying network issues. In the cyber security aspect, it has fostered a mindset of protecting an orgzanization's assets, and integrity, since working in a security environment entails having a high level of clearance and confidentiality, and an increased proactive mindset. Although, I have not directly worked in a IT environment, it interests me to undertand in depth, how networks communicate, risk management and analysis, learning about threat intelligence, and be a valuable asset by being proactive and learn different strategies to protect an organization.

**Career Plans**

My aspirations and goals after completing the cybersecurity course is to land an opportunity where I can apply all skills learned, and can further apply the soft skills I have acquired throughout the course and my work experience in the Physical Security Industry which include: communication, adaptability, team collaboration, and critical thinking, amongst others. Upon completion of the course, I look forward to applying to the following roles / Industries: SOC Analyst, Digital Forensics, Cybsersecurity Analyst, IT Security, etc.

**Proud Project/Task**

A project/task that I am proud of and that stands out for me is when I was assigned in my current role to strategically add video analytics to all the perimeter surverillance system throughout the facility. To me this was a great accomplishment because I went from having zero knowledge to becoming the subject matter expert and being able to elaborate and effectively explain it to my colleagues. It all started when I created a detailed spreadsheet with images depicting all security vulnerabilities when I peformed a thorough walkthrough, and made recommendations to the management team, and analytics were part of my recommendations. Also, in statges of the projects where I was stuck, I reached out to management, and scheduled meetings to ensure I was on the right track. This project made me apply myself, become more resourceful with limited information, to sucessfully creating a detailed step by step manual.
